# Data Analysis Class Projects

This repository contains a series of mini-projects developed during the Data Analysis class in the second semester of RT3.

For the classification project, you'll need to download the well-known MNIST dataset from the following link: [MNIST Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dhg_hZmfHQoWBY35dg-Tq-CEwahUxgac/view?usp=sharing)

The TP_classification project involves the implementation of the k-means algorithm. It utilizes the adjusted Rand score to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, it compares the accuracy of another k-means classification that uses 90% of the original information. This is achieved by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reach 90% compression with loss.

The exercises corresponding to TP1 are provided in the following document: [Exercises Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17eB-peaKBAMR-FFs9_eAtZ6C4v92oy7o/view?usp=sharing)
